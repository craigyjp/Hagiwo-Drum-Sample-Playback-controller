# Hagiwo-Drum-Sample-Playback-controller
Programmer section for 16 Hagiwo Drum sample Modules

Started building the programmer to control 16 Hagiwo Drum modules. I didn't want a sea of knobs and buttons because basically I don't have any to buy and I have limited space. So I have a couple of buttons to select the drum modules 1-16, could be changed to an encoder and 4 controls to set parameters for the drum module, an encoder to select drum sample 1-48, a tuning pot, a volume pot and a low pass filter on/off button. So far so good, I've used a larger screen to get all the relevant information needed for each patch and drum.

Add menus for the drum names
